# Readmission-Prediction-Model-and-Outreach

# Background
The Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP), a 30-day risk standardized unplanned readmission measures, penalizes hospitals by withholding up to 3% of regular reimbursements if the facility has a higher-than-expected number of readmissions within 30 days of discharge for certain conditions.  This measure applies to patients who are readmitted to the same hospital, or another applicable acute care hospital for any reason.
# Problem
Hospital readmissions are associated with unfavorable patient outcomes and high financial costs. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) estimated that about 12% of readmissions are potentially avoidable. Preventing even a small percentage of these readmissions could save billions of dollars. Causes of readmissions are multi-factorial and rates vary substantially by institution. Historically, nearly 20% of all Medicare discharges had a readmission within 30 days. Balancing index Length of Stay with readmission risk is vital, one of the more striking inter-hospital differences has been variation in the length of stay for the index hospitalization. It has been shown that longer length of stay for heart failure hospitalizations appear to lead to lower rates of readmission. 
# Solution
Develop an all-cause 30-day readmission predictive model, which can be adopted for DRG-based readmission model to determine patients with high-risk score of being readmitted prior to discharge and proactively outreaching to same cohort by outbound call to ensure they don’t end up being readmitted. Care Management teams that have this information when a patient is admitted for care can appropriately plan & tailor their discharge plans to account for barriers before a patient leaves their facility. Taking that data in real-time to formulate a readmission risk score can help identify patients who may have barriers including SDOH. Model accuracy is 98% with AUC of 84%.

# Outcome to Customer
With increasing numbers of target conditions included, more Medicare-participating hospitals have been penalized, saving Medicare millions of dollars. The HRRP has changed the landscape of hospital readmissions and reimbursement within the United States:
•	Improve transitions of care and reduce unnecessary readmissions as one of national quality initiatives.
•	Hospitals have focused on transitional care measures that are aimed to improve total care delivery.
•	Cost saving measures by avoiding penalties.
